# Migrate from Chrome App (v2.0)

The [previous version of Insomnia](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insomnia-rest-client/gmodihnfibbjdecbanmpmbmeffnmloel) 
was a Chrome application, installed via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).
Due to certain limitations of Chrome Apps, I rewrote Insomnia using the 
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework to be a native desktop app.

Luckily for you, **Upgrading from the Chrome app is easy**. Just follow these three simple steps.


## Step 1 – Export Data from Insomnia 2.0

- Open Insomnia 2.0 (Chrome App)
- Open to Settings by clicking the dropdown menu in the top left
- Click the _Export_ button
- Save the file to your computer


## Step 2 – Import Data into Insomnia 3.0

- Open Insomnia 3.0 
- Open to Settings by clicking the dropdown menu in the top left
- Click the _Import_ button
- Select the file that you saved in the previous step


## Step 3 – Enjoy the App!

That's it! You can now use Insomnia 3.0 and never look back!
