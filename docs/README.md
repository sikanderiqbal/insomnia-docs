# Insomnia HTTP Client 

Welcome to the documentation site for [Insomnia](http://insomnia.rest). 
Insomnia is a beautiful cross-platform application for organizing, running, and 
debugging HTTP requests.

## Backstory and History

I started Insomnia in January of 2015. I was helping build the API platform for
([Sendwithus](https://www.sendwithus.com)) at the time, so a large part of my day-to-day was 
interacting with HTTP APIs. 

Before Insomnia, I used [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) to test the API features being worked on.
However, it was painful to build a new command for every test case, so I eventually ended up with 
a messy folder of scripts that looked something like this.

```
curl-commands/
 ├── send-email.sh
 ├── send-email-bad-data.sh
 ├── update-customer.sh
 ├── ...
 └── create-email-template.sh
```

It started off manageable, but slowly turned into a nightmare. Doing something trivial like changing 
the API key that was being sent sometimes meant modifying every file. Sure, I could have used an
environment variable for that, but what if I wanted to change something else? Finally, after a lot
of pain, I realized there was probably a better way.

I eventually stumbled upon the world of _REST Clients_. These were usually poorly designed 
(my opinion) web apps built to solve this exact problem. So, I tried them. All of them. And, 
after a few days, still didn't find one that I liked. So I wrote my own.

The first version was built from a $15 [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/) theme, a couple 
hundred likes of JQuery, and was distributed via the 
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). It was horrible but it worked, and slowly
evolved to where it is today. 

You can download Insomnia today by visiting [http://insomnia.rest](http://insomnia.rest).

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the app!
